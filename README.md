# SHAP Analysis for Recommender Model

## Overview
This Python code utilizes the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library to explain the predictions of a recommender model trained using a RandomForestRegressor. It provides insights into how the features influence the model's predictions, aiding in understanding the model's behavior and making recommendations more interpretable.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy library
- pandas library
- SHAP library
- scikit-learn library

## Usage

- Data Preparation:
Replace "your_data.csv" with the path to your actual dataset containing features related to courses and user preferences. Ensure that the dataset is loaded into a DataFrame named 'data' with columns representing features and a column 'rating' indicating user ratings for each course.
- Model Training:
Split the data into features (X) and the target variable (y). Then, split the data into training and test sets using train_test_split.
- Model Training:
Train a RandomForestRegressor model as a recommender model using the training data.
- SHAP Analysis:
Initialize a SHAP explainer (Explainer) with the trained model and the training data.
Generate SHAP values (shap_values) for the test data to explain the model's predictions.
- Visualization:
Visualize the SHAP summary plot using shap.summary_plot to understand the feature importances and their effects on the model predictions.

## Example
The provided code assumes the existence of a DataFrame named 'data' containing features related to courses and user preferences, as well as a column 'rating' indicating user ratings for each course.
It trains a RandomForestRegressor model as a recommender model and generates SHAP values to explain the model's predictions.
Finally, it visualizes the SHAP summary plot to understand feature importances.
